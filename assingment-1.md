Assignment - General programming logic.
---------------------------------------

Instructions: 
1) Avoid using input/print statements in the actual methods.
2) Follow proper naming conventions. Other team members should able to understand the logic/    functionality by seeing the method names, variable names etc.,
3) Write proper comments wherever it required like above method, above conditions/loops ect.,
4) Avoid redundant/duplicate code.  Reuse the code/method wherever it required.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problems : 

1.	Write a function to add two numbers.  
2.	Write a function to get biggest between 2 numbers.
3.	Write a function to find whether the give number is even or not
4.	Write a function to get grade of 3 subject marks.
a.	Grade is based on average of 3 subject marks
i.	Average>90  => A+
ii.	Average<90 and average>=80 => A
iii.	Average<80 and average>=70 => A-
iv.	Average<70 and average>=60 => B+
v.	Average<60 and average>=50 => B
vi.	Average<50  => FAIL

5.	Write a function to print first 10 natural numbers
6.	Write a function to print first 10 natural numbers in reverse order
7.	Write a function to print first 10 even natural numbers
8.	Write a function to print numbers between the range ( say  10 to 100 OR 100 to 200 etc.,)
9.	Write a function to print mathematical table of given number
10.	Write a function to find whether the given number is prime or not.
11.	Write a program to print prime numbers between 2 to 100
12.	Write a function to get sum of individual digits of given number
a.	i/p:  123  =>  output : 6    ( i.e., 1+2+3)
13.	Write a function to get lucky number of given number
a.	Lucky number => sum of individual digits of given number
b.	If the sum is more than 9, again do sum of individual digits of this sum.
i.	i/p :   12345  =>  6   ( i.e., 1+2+3+4+5 = 15,  1+5 = 6)  
14.	Write a function to get reverse of given number
15.	Write a function to find whether the given number is palindrome or not
16.	Write a function to find factorial of given number
17.	Write a program to find ncr.     Hint :   ncr = ( n! /  (   (n-r)! * r!)
18.	Write a function to find sum of individual digits of given number
19.	Write a function to get reverse of given number
20.	Write a function to find whether the given number is palindrome or not.
21.	Write a function to convert given digit into the word format.
a.	If i/p is 1  ->  output : One
b.	If i/p is 2 -> output : Two etc.,
22.	Write a function to convert given number into word format.
a.	If i/p is 123 -> output :  One Hundred Twenty Three
